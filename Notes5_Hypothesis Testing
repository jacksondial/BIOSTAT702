Hypothesis Testing

Steps:

1) Know the data, study design and assumptions
2) Set up statistical hypotheses
  - 2-sided are \neq
  - 1-tailed are <= & > | >= & <
3) Choose a test statistic and determine the sampling distribution
  - Test statistic could be the mean, median, or even just the first sampled observation
4) Calculate the test statistical value and p-value
5) Draw inference based on significance level

Type I error: Rejecting the null when the null is true, we fix this in practice to be small and  denote is by \alpha = P(reject H_o | H_o is true)

Type II error: Failing to reject the null when the alternative is true, denoted by \beta = P(fail to reject H_o | H_a is true)

Power: The power of the statistical test is (1-\beta) the probability of rejecting the null when the alternative is true.

\alpha and \beta are inversely related, but the only way to decrease both of them simulatneously is to increase sample size.



Type I: Rejecting the null when the null is true and the alternative is false
Type I: \alpha

Type II: Rejecting the alternative when the alternative is true
Type II: \beta

Power = (1- \beta)
