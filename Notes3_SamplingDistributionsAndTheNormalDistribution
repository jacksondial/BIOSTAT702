population: collection of elements of interest with some interested characteristic
variable: a characteeristics that takes different values for different elemnts in the population
random sample: a siubset of independently and randomle selected elements from a population
random variable: a characteristic that takes fdifferent values for different elements in sample
sample space: the set of all possilble outcomes of a random variable
probability: relative frequency of an outcome to all possible outcomes in the sample space

Probability Mass Function
PMF: funciton that maps a value to a probability

Probability Distribution Function
PDF: Same thing but for continuous random variables; function maps an interval of y values to the AUC over that interval. The AUC is the probability that Y falls within the interval

Cumulative Distribution Function
CDF: PDF that maps some value to being less than or equal to that value


Random variables have expected values. They also have probability distributions.

Standard error is the standard deviation for the random variable S. The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic. 
Standard error is the specific sd of how the sample statistic varies around the a sample statistic.
How a statistic varies around its own population mean value.

the standard deviation of each of these:
S: standard deviation
S^2: variance
Y_bar: mean
is a standard error

standard error = variance/sqrt(n) #I think I heard that right
