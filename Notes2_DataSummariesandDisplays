Data Types:

-Categorical Data:

1) Binary: only two values are possible, cover all possibilities
2) Nominal: values are unordered groups for which there is no natural ordering
3) Ordinal: values recorded are categorized in a natural ordering

-Quantitative Data:

1) Discrete: possible values are isolated (a 'countable' set of values)
2) Continuous: theoretically, a value always exists between any two given numbers (an 'uncountable' set of values)
*usually do not distinguish between interval and ratio data. Ratio means 0 has a meaningful value


Numerical Summaries:

-measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
-measures of spread: standard deviation, variance

Order statistics are the sample data sorted from smallest to largest

Sample variance is the average of the squared deviations of each datum value from the mean, deonted by s^2

The standard deviation is the non negative square root of the variance --> s = sqrt(s^2)

Variance:
-deviations divided by (n-1)
-adding constants does not change variance
-always >= 0, if it is o, it is because all values are exactly the same

IQR is the diistance between the 25th and 75th quantiles

The whiskers on a boxplot are 1.5 times the IQR
Values outside of the whiskers are always labeled as outliers in boxplots
