Section 9: Contingency Tables

A contingency table is what is used in a Chi-squared test of independence.

Sample from R populations, observe a variable classifide in C categories is a chi-squared test of homogeneity - assess whether the probabilities are the same across the two populations

Sample from one population, observe two characteristics on each unit- chi squared test of independence - assess if the two characteristics are independent of each other.

Sample from one population and just one random variable - chi squared goodness of fit test - assess whether observed data were sampled  form some specified distribution



When sample sizes or expected counts are small, we should do fisher's exact test instead of chi-squared tests.
