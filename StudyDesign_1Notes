Scientific Process in Clinical Research
1) Observation/Pattern
2) Research Question
3) Hypothesis
4) Study Design/Data Collection
5) Statistical Analysis
6) Results/Conclusion

The primary outcome is a specific characteristic that is most suitable to answer the research quesiton. it is: 
  -measurable: a value can be computed for every individual in the study
  -clinically meaningful: a good proxy for the clinical phenomenon under study
  -of greatest importance: the characteristic the researcher is most interested in

Hawthorne effect: If individuals in a study know they are being watched or observed, their behavior may be different. This can introduce an observation bias into the data


## Measurement Timing:

Single Observation: one measurement at one point in time for each participant

Longitudinal: repeated information on each study participant in order to measure change over time

Spatial: collects a set of variables in different location on each observaitonal unit at one point in time, with an intnen to determine if some geographic areas are different from others


Our three observational study designs we will examine:
  -Cohort
  -Case-Control
  -Cross-Sectional

Cohort study is usually prospective, each cohort is usually risk factor or exposure.
We can estimate conditional probabilities that do not require knowleged of the relative proportions of exposed and unexposed in the population.

Case-control study is usually retrospective, obsevational study in which the people are selected form those falling into the categories of the outcome
We can estimate conditional probabilities that do not require knowledge of the relative proportions of diseased and non dieseased in the population
