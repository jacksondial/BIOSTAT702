Section 8 notes: Paired Tests and Nonparametric Tests

Benefits of pairing:
  - Each person is own control, reduces variability
  - if correlation between pairs is high, variability of the difference between the groups will be lower
  - Only need to sample n people
  
Drawbacks of pairing:
  - Fewer degrees of freedom, yielding higher critical values
  - If someone drops out, that is 2 observations lost instead of just 1, section 8-5
  
"-2psigma_1sigma_2" is the covariance, which is subtracted off and is what reduces the variance

Nonparametric and distribution free are used interchangibly, though there is a slight difference. nonparametric means we are testing a statistic that does not have a parameter. Such as an associaiton.... there is not really a parameter. Distribution free means that my test statistic does not have a known, named sampling distribution.


A wilcoxon signed-rank test is for a one-sample or paired data setting and is distribution-less

A p-value for a wilcoxon signed-rank test is approximate if there are ties, if there are none, the p-value is exact



Mann-Whitney test: distribution free/nonparametric alternative to a two-sample t-test (also called Wilcoxon rank-sum test)
  -assumes two samples are independent
  -the variable of interest is continuous
  -we in this class will also assume two distributions are different
